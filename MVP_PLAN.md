ÔøΩÔøΩ Core Goal

Build a comprehensive backend system that can:

1. Allow GameMasters to create structured games with AI or manual verification
2. Let Players join, commit stake, and progress through checkpoints
3. Track state in memory with proper validation and logic
4. Distribute stakes and bonuses fairly at game end
5. Use robust error handling with the Result pattern
6. Support AI-powered verification with security safeguards
7. Handle complex game mechanics with checkpoints, expiry dates, and proof submissions

## üéØ Questions for Next Implementation Phase

### Background Worker Questions:

1. **Scheduling Frequency**: How often should we check for expired games/checkpoints? (every minute, 5 minutes, hourly?)
2. **Retry Strategy**: How many times should we retry failed AI verifications before marking as NEEDS_REVIEW?
3. **Grace Periods**: Should there be grace periods for checkpoint expiry or strict enforcement?
4. **Notification System**: Do we need to notify players/GameMasters of expiry events?

### AI Testing Questions:

1. **API Provider**: Should we test with OpenAI, Anthropic, or both?
2. **Media Types**: Which media types should we prioritize? (text, images, videos, documents)
3. **Test Data**: Should we create realistic game scenarios for AI testing?
4. **Performance**: What are acceptable response times for AI verification?

### System Architecture Questions:

1. **Worker Persistence**: Should background jobs survive server restarts?
2. **Scaling**: How should the system handle multiple concurrent games?
3. **Monitoring**: What metrics should we track for system health?
4. **Configuration**: How should AI models/providers be configurable?
